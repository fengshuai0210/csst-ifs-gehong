Single Star
===========

The spectrum of single stellar is modeled by the stellar template of `XSL <http://xsl.u-strasbg.fr/>`_ 
(`Verro et al. 2022 <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022A%26A...660A..34V/abstract>`_), which is 
a stellar library with moderate-to-high spectral resolution observed by the VLT X-shooter. The key parameters are effective tempreture, metallicity and surface gravity, 
which is enthough to select one spectrum from stellar library. Similar to spectrum of continuum of stellar disk, the flux of single stellar spectrum is calibrated 
by the input magnitude (e.g. in SDSS r-band).
