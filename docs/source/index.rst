**GEHONG** (GEnerate tHe data Of iNtegral field spectrograph of Galaxy) is a Python package
developed for simulating high-resolution, three-dimensional (3D) spectroscopic data cubes
observed with ideal integral field spectrographs (IFS). It is specifically designed to support
the science preparation of the **Chinese Space Station Telescope Integral Field Spectrograph
(CSST-IFS)**, but is also applicable to other IFS instruments.

Given two-dimensional maps describing spatially resolved physical properties of target
sources, such as stellar population, surface brightness, line-of-sight velocity, and gas-phase
metallicity, **GEHONG** generates synthetic 3D datacubes by assembling position-dependent
one-dimensional spectra. These spectra can be composed of up to four components:

- stellar continuum
- ionized gas emission lines
- AGN spectra
- individual stellar spectra

**GEHONG** is capable of producing mock observations of a wide range of astrophysical systems,
including galaxies, AGNs, star clusters, and H‚ÄØII regions. The input parameter maps can be
derived from either analytic models, observational data, or hydrodynamic simulations.

**GEHONG** plays a key role in simulating idealized datacubes for CSST-IFS scientific pre-studies.
These datacubes can serve as inputs for:

- the CSST-IFS raw image simulator (**CSST-IFS-SIM**), which generates mock CCD images
  from ideal datacubes. `Online access <https://csst-tb.bao.ac.cn/code/csst-sims/csst_ifs_sim>`_

- the exposure time calculator (**CSST-IFS-ETC**), which estimates the signal-to-noise
  ratio of mock observations and helps optimize exposure configurations. This tool can be
  accessed both as a `Python package <https://pypi.org/project/ifs-etc/>`_ and via a
  `web-based interface <http://60.204.173.65:9091/#/tool/ifs-etc-task>`_

- other planning tools for observation simulation and survey strategy design
