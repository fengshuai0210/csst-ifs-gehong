Please download the :download:`example <data/example.zip>` , which provided the step-by-step
usage of spectra modelling based on `gehong`. The `.zip` comprises four files. 
* `Example_Spec1D.ipynb` shows the modelling of single spectra, such as 
emission line of ionzed gas, stellar continuum of galaxies, spectrum of single star, 
and the spectrum of active galactic nuclei. 
* `Example_Map2D.ipynb` shows the modelling of 2D-maps, such as surface brigheness
of galaxies, velocity maps, and many other 2D-maps of galaxy parameters.
* `Example_Cube3D.ipynb` shows the modelling of data cube of galaxies simulated by 
IllustrisTNG.
* `TNG_Example.fits` is the 2D-maps of galaxy parameters extracted from IllustrisTNG-50.
