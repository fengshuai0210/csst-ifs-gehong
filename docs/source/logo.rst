Logo and Name of GEHONG
=======================

The name **GEHONG** is inspired by the historical Chinese Taoist scholar and alchemist **Ge Hong** (葛洪, 283–343), also known by his literary pseudonym *Baopuzi* (抱朴子).  
See: `Wikipedia (葛洪) <https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%91%9B%E6%B4%AA>`_

Origin of the Name
------------------

In traditional Chinese alchemy, Ge Hong was renowned for refining elixirs from diverse ingredients through mysterious techniques.  
This resonates with the philosophy of the GEHONG software: **assembling complex physical models and observational inputs (the “ingredients”) to generate IFS datacubes (the “elixir”)**.

Originally, the name was chosen to metaphorically capture this idea of "spectral alchemy" for astronomical data.

CSST Coincidence and Reinforcement
----------------------------------

By chance, the author came across a Ming dynasty painting of Ge Hong, shown below:

In this painting, a mysterious symbol appears in the **top-left corner**, which strikingly resembles the structure of the **Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST)**:

Given that this package was specifically developed for simulating CSST-IFS observations, this serendipitous visual echo strengthened the naming choice—**GEHONG** became a perfect fit.

Logo Design
-----------

Inspired by the portrait, the author worked with ChatGPT to design a custom logo for this package.

The official logo includes the following elements:

- A **cartoon-styled Ge Hong figure** in the center, based on the Ming dynasty portrait.
- A **cartoon CSST telescope** in the top-left corner, referencing CSST's role in the project.
- A **3D datacube galaxy diagram** in the top-right, symbolizing the simulated output of the GEHONG package.

This logo reflects the unique fusion of traditional Chinese culture and cutting-edge astronomical simulation, and serves as a playful "easter egg" within the documentation.
